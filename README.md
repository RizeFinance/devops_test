*    We want to serve these services from a single server on port 1212 (sinatra) and 206 (webrick)

*    (Extra credit) on Tuesday & Thursday we want to serve webrick on port 1212 and sinatra on port 206

*    Changes to the git repo should trigger automated test/build/deploy

*    Create one or more Dockerfiles to containerize these servers

*    Create a simple ansible/puppet/saltstack/chef/etc. script to provision any needed resources on the target deployment server

*    Describe each step of the CI/CD pipeline you would implement to ensure high availability

*    What EC2 instance type would be most appropriate for this deployment and why?
